The AI engineer successfully built a medical audio transcription and clinical note structuring web system (AudioMedic) from scratch using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. The process began with clarifying product requirements, including specific AI services (OpenAI Whisper/GPT-5) and authentication (JWT). Initial MVP development included core UI, backend endpoints, and MongoDB integration.

A critical challenge arose with the  not supporting OpenAI Whisper for audio transcription, leading to a temporary mock implementation before integrating a user-provided  for real Whisper transcription. Subsequently, a subscription model with admin control was integrated, followed by a comprehensive security overhaul (strong passwords, rate limiting, Bcrypt, security headers). Debugging phase 2 security features revealed a common routing issue, which was promptly resolved. The final phase involved preparing the application for deployment, culminating in adapting the architecture for shared Hostinger hosting, splitting the frontend and backend.

<product_requirements>
The user, a software architect specializing in medical AI applications, requested a complete technical blueprint and a functional MVP for a web system (AudioMedic). This system captures medical consultation audio, automatically transcribes it into text, and structures clinical notes. It must be 100% online, prioritize privacy, security, and transcription accuracy, and serve as a prototype for learning.

Key functionalities include:
1.  **Audio Capture & Transcription:** Via browser microphone, secure HTTPS + JWT upload, using OpenAI Whisper API.
2.  **NLP & Structuring:** Processing transcribed text into clinical sections (anamnesis, physical exam, diagnostic hypothesis, conduct) using GPT-5 (OpenAI) or Claude Sonnet 4.
3.  **Data Storage:** MongoDB for users, recordings, transcriptions, and logs.
4.  **UI/UX:** Clean, responsive web interface (React), with record/pause, audio player, transcription display, edit, and export functions.
5.  **Security & Compliance:** Encryption, explicit consent, automatic recording deletion post-transcription, LGPD/HIPAA compliance.
6.  **Authentication:** Email/password with JWT, strong password policy, rate limiting, brute-force protection, Bcrypt hashing, security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), CORS.
7.  **Advanced Security (Phase 2):** Email verification on registration, password recovery via email token, and optional MFA (TOTP) for admins.
8.  **Subscription Model:** Manual admin control, R$ 99,90/month, 7-day grace period, then read-only access.
9.  **Deployment Prep:** Documentation and scripts for Hostinger, adapted for shared hosting (frontend on Hostinger, backend on free service like Render).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was working on adapting the application for deployment on Hostinger shared hosting, as the user indicated they do not have a VPS. This involves a hybrid deployment strategy where the React frontend will be hosted on Hostinger shared hosting, and the FastAPI backend will be deployed to a free service like Render.

The following steps were completed as part of this effort:
1.  **Creation of **: A new guide specifically for this hybrid deployment scenario was created in .
2.  **Creation of **: A Render blueprint file was created in  to define the backend service deployment on Render.
3.  **Creation of **: An  file was created in . This file is essential for configuring URL rewriting rules on Apache web servers, commonly used in shared hosting environments, to ensure proper routing for the React frontend application.

The last message from the user was Continue de onde paramos, and the AI engineer's last action was to state, Vou continuar criando os recursos necess√°rios para hospedagem compartilhada, indicating that the work on preparing the application for shared hosting is ongoing and not yet complete. The application itself, with all its features, security, and subscription model, is functional, but the deployment artifacts for this specific hosting environment are still being generated.

<optional_next_step>
Continue creating the remaining resources and documentation necessary for the shared Hostinger hosting adaptation.
